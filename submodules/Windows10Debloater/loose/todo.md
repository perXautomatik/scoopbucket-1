  import runhistory.. somehowe (shouldn't be hardcoded)
  import currated extensionlist for browser.

to figure out
  how to autostinall extension to browsers..
  simply running a urllist with xpi files, or find a snazier method

  
to think about
  what should be harcoded and what should be dynamically updated.

  i think the choclatere list could be a dynamic list for example.
  the reg changes.
  the nonconventional programs is another problem though.

  add PathVariables.
