#In the future, you might want to update `npm`. On Windows, just running `npm i -g npm` doesn't always do what it should, so use `npm-windows-upgrade` instead:

npm install -g npm-windows-upgrade

#### Python
#Python is a complex world with a bunch of flavors, but Python 3, pip, and easy_install should have you prepared for most things.

cinst python
cinst pip
cinst easy.install
#If you intend to work with Node.js, know that compiling native Node modules usually requires Python 2.7 instead of Python 3. For Node development, do not install Python 3 - instead, run these commands:

cinst python2


#### Docker, VirtualBox, Vagrant
#If you want to run Docker machines and images, you might not need VirtualBox. In fact, installing VirtualBox on your system isn't always the best idea, given that it messes with a few system components.

#Docker released a version for OS X and Windows that no longer requires VirtualBox to be installed - 
#and instead uses the default Hypervisor that comes with the operating system (on Windows, that's Hyper-V). You can [read more about it over in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
