# Win10 Optimization Script With Extra GPD Win Tweaks
# Adapted version of https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script by Disassembler <disassembler@dasm.cz>
# Author: BlackDragonBE
# Version: v2.2.1 (2017-12-02)
# Copied from https://www.reddit.com/r/gpdwin/comments/6ipa6c/windows_10_optimization_script_for_gpd_win/
# Tweaked Win10 Initial Setup Script
# Primary Author: Disassembler <disassembler@dasm.cz>
# Modified by: alirobe <alirobe@alirobe.com> based on my personal preferences.
# Version: 2.20.2, 2018-09-14
# Primary Author Source: https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script
# Tweaked Source: https://gist.github.com/alirobe/7f3b34ad89a159e6daa1/
# Tweak difference:
#
#    @alirobe's version is a subset focused on safely disabling telemetry, some 'smart' features and 3rd party bloat ...
#    ... while retaining win10 defaults + security features. Aim to be suitable for end-user rollout.
#
#    If you're a power user looking to tweak your machinea, or doing larger roll-out..
#    Use the @Disassembler0 script instead. It'll probably be more up-to-date than mine:
#    https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script
#
#    Note from author: Never run scripts without reading them & understanding what they do.
#
##########
# Default preset
# As a workaround for disabled script execution, run this command (without #) in an elevated PowerShell windows first and choose "all" if you're asked where to apply this:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
