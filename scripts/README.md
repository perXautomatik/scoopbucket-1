scoop-bucket

### Scoop bucket for development tools, be it game dev or just regular software development.


Add this bucket after installing Scoop by typing: ```scoop bucket add DEV-Tools https://github.com/anderlli0053/DEV-tools.git```

Even faster way is ```scoop bucket add DEV-Tools https://github.com/anderlli0053/DEV-tools.git && scoop update && scoop install <anyAPPNameInTheBucket>```

Installing example:

* ```scoop install gdevelop```

or basically ```scoop install <anyAPPNameInTheBucket>```

For updating the bucket with the upstream use ```scoop update```, for other commands you can write ```scoop``` and press ENTER, it will output the list of available Scoop commands.

Once the Scoop is sucessfully installed and in the System PATH, you can use whatever command-line you like, CMD, PowerShell,...
