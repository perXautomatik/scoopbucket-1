# retain windows line-endings in case checked out on mac or linux
# Since Scoop is a Windows-only tool, we can safely use CRLF line endings for all text files.
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings will be normalized to CRLF in the working tree on checkout.
# In the Git index/repository the files will always be stored with LF line endings. This is fine.
