## How to use and adopt this bucket

1. Click on `Use this template` to create new repository in your account with same files
1. Open project settings and **give your bucket in new name**
1. Add proper description of repository
    - Information about what type of manifests could be found here
1. Add `scoop-bucket` tag for repository
    - Your manifests will be automatically available at <https://scoop-docs.now.sh/apps/>
1. Enable appveyor CI/CD
    1. Register / Login to [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/login)
    1. Click `New Project`
    1. From Left Panel, choose your source control variant (Github)
    1. From Right Panel, choose repository with bucket and click `+ Add`
    1. üéâ Project created and ready to build üéâ
    1. Get Badge URL
        1. Open Appveyor Project settings
        1. Navigate to Badges
        1. Copy `Branch Sample markdown code` snippet for further usage
            - Only master branch is better, since you can freely test in other branches and do not mystificate users
            - [You could use alternative styles](https://shields.io/category/build#styles)
1. Clone project into some folder
    - `git clone git@github.com:USER/REPO.git MyAwesomeBucket`
    - or
    - `git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git MyAwesomeBucket`
1. Open vscode with this clone
    - `code MyAwesomeBucket`
1. _[optional]_ Configure remote repository
    1. `git remote add 'upstream' 'https://github.com/Ash258/GenericBucket.git'`
    - This step will allow you to synchronize changes with this template repository
    - If some changes are pushed into this repository and you want to reflect them into your bucket, you can simply do something like:
        - `git fetch --all`
        - `git checkout -B upstream-master -t upstream/master`
        - Do changes
        - `git merge master` or create PR in github
1. Create proper README.md
    1. [Open this README in the browser for reference](https://github.com/Ash258/GenericBucket/tree/master/README.md)
    1. Open `README.template.md`
    1. Replace all `%%templatestring%%` with real and according values
        1. Replace appveyor status badge with yours
            - See: <https://appveyor.com/docs/status-badges/>
    1. Override this README with completed `README.template.md`
    1. Remove template `README.template.md`
1. Repository tweaks
    1. Open `.github\CODEOWNERS` and change `@Ash258` to desired github username
    1. Actions
        1. Open each file in `.github\workflows` and change `youremail@email.com` with your email
        1. Visit <https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-GithubActions> for more information
